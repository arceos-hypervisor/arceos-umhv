# Since we need to rely on the `axtask` module from the `monolithic` branch of arceos-org/arceos repository, which supports TaskExt,
# and this module depends on different versions of `axhal` and `axconfig`, 
# (ref: https://github.com/arceos-org/arceos/blob/monolithic/modules/axtask/Cargo.toml)
# we temporarily use [patch] here to unify the dependency versions of these modules.

# The complexity: 
# `axstd` depends on the `axtask` from the `arceos-hypervisor\arceos` repository when the 'multitask' feature is enabled. 
# Here, we use [patch] to unify `axtask` to the one from the `monolithic` branch of the arceos-org/arceos repository.
